# A Web-Based Mission Planning and Digital Twin Environment for Autonomous Robotics

This repository accompanies a research project exploring a browser-based
mission planning and autonomous execution environment for constrained robotic systems.

The system provides an interactive digital twin of the operating environment,
allowing users to design, validate, and execute autonomous missions prior to
deployment on physical hardware.

## Motivation
Autonomous robotic systems—ranging from competition robots to spacecraft—
require reliable mission planning, simulation, and execution pipelines.
Current tools are often fragmented, hardware-specific, or inaccessible to
early-stage researchers.

This project investigates whether a lightweight, web-based platform can
bridge high-level mission planning and low-level control while improving
repeatability and reliability.

## Contributions
- A browser-based mission planning IDE with real-time environment visualization
- A digital twin framework for pre-execution validation
- A modular interface between planning and low-level control
- Experimental evaluation on a physical robotic platform
